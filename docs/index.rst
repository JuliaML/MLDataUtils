MLDataUtils.jl's documentation
=================================

This package represents a community effort to provide common
functionality to generate, load, split, and process Machine Learning
datasets in Julia. As such, it is a part of the
`JuliaML <https://github.com/JuliaML>`_ ecosystem.
In contrast to other data-centered packages, MLDataUtils focuses
specifically on functionality utilized in a Machine Learning
context.

Where to begin?
----------------

If this is the first time you consider using MLDataUtils for your
machine learning related experiments or packages, make sure to
check out the "Getting Started" section; specifically "How to
...?", which lists some of most common scenarios and links to the
appropriate places that should guide you on how to approach these
scenarios using the functionality provided by this or other
packages.

Introduction and Motivation
-----------------------------

If you are new to Machine Learning in Julia, or are simply
interested in how and why this package works the way it works,
feel free to take a look at the following documents.
There we discuss the problem of data-partitioning itself and what
challenges it entails.
Further we will provide some insight on how this package
approaches the task conceptually.

Using MLDataUtils.jl
---------------------

While the sole focus of the whole package is on data-related
functionality, we can further divide the provided types and functions
into a number of quite heterogeneous sub-categories.

Data Access Pattern
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The core of the package, and indeed the part that thus far
received the most developer attention, are the data access
pattern. These include data-partitioning, -subsampling, and
-iteration. The main design principle behind the access pattern
is based on the assumption that the data-source a user is working
with is likely of some very user-specific custom type. That said,
there was also a lot of attention put into first class support
for those types that are most commonly employed to represent the
data of interest, such as ``Array``.

Data Processing
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

This package contains a number of simple pre-processing
strategies that are often applied for ML purposes, such as
feature centering and rescaling.

Data Generators
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

When studying learning algorithm or other ML related
functionality, it is usually of high interest to empirically test
the behaviour of the system under specific conditions.
Generators can provide the means to fabricate artificial data
sets that observe certain attributes, which can help to deepen
the understanding of the system under investigation.

Example Datasets
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

We provide a small number of toy datasets. These are mainly
intended for didactic and testing purposes.
